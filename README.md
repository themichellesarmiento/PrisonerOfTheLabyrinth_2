## 🚀 Future Improvements or Plans
- ⏳ Add multiple ghosts, add traps that would make player lose a turn. 
- ⏳ Make freezing crystal to use later option available.
- ⏳ Improve ghost movement logic, as its moves can be blocked by the wall. To improve, it should find an alternative direction that still brings closer to the player once blocked by the wall oe exit.
- ⏳ Randomized map: generate key, walls, exit randomly when game starts.
- ⏳ Make certain number of moves , eg. 10 moves before automatic game over.
- ⏳ Visual HTML grid version.
